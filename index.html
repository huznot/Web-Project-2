            <h1>Treaty One</h1>
            <p>
                Treaty No. 1, also known as the "Stone Fort Treaty," was signed at Lower Fort Garry on August 3, 1871, between the Canadian Crown and seven First Nations. The treaty granted European settlers access to Indigenous lands for agriculture and industrial development, while protecting certain Indigenous rights.

            <p>
                The Treaty involved several First Nations including: 
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><span>Brokenhead Ojibway Nation</span> - Anishinaabe (Saulteaux/Ojibwa) nation</li>

                <h2>Differences from Other Treaties</h2>
                <p>
                    Treaty One is unique in its timing as the first of the numbered treaties, setting a precedent for negotiations between the Crown and Indigenous peoples. Unlike later treaties, it was negotiated during a period of intense settlement and development in the Canadian west.

                <h2>Historic Terms of Treaty</h2>
                <p>
                    Some promises made by the Crown included giving 160 acres of land for every family of five, with adjustments for smaller or larger families; building and maintaining a school on each reserve; paying each family of five $15, with proportional amounts for different family sizes; and reserving specific areas of land exclusively for the First Nations living there.
                </p>

            <div class="topic">
                <!-- Modern implementation  -->
                <h2>Modern Implementation</h2>
                <p>
                    Treaty One is still being implemented today. Such as the Kapyong Urban Reserve in Winnipeg, once a military base, is being transformed by Treaty One First Nations into a space for housing, businesses, and community services. Similarly, the Long Plain First Nations Gas Station contributes to local economic growth by providing jobs and revenue for the community. It also provides indigenous people with treaty status to buy tobacco products and gas free from provincial sales tax. These efforts reflect a commitment to restoring land and fostering self-sufficiency for Treaty One communities.
