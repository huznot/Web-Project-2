                <h1>History</h1>
                <p>Treaty One was the first in a series of Canada's Numbered Treaties, signed on August 3, 1871, at Lower Fort Garry in Manitoba. This was between the Government of Canada and a number of Indigenous peoples, including the Anishinaabe and Swampy Cree. The aim of the treaty was to permit European settlers into the lands of the Indigenous people for farming, settlement, and resource development, while support was allegedly provided for Indigenous communities transitioning into the new ways of life.

                    Whereas the indigenous signatories are supposed to get rights, the payments and provisions include annual annuities, agricultural supplies, and tools in addition to reserve lands in return for vast tracts of land. However, most of those promises were broken or misinterpreted by the government under that treaty, which brought a number of long-standing problems. Today, the relevance of Treaty One remains intact, as many Indigenous communities still fight for the complete fulfillment of its conditions, together with recognition of their rights in conformity with the original agreement.

                    Some promises made by the Crown included giving 160 acres of land for every family of five, with adjustments for smaller or larger families; building and maintaining a school on each reserve; paying each family of five $15, with proportional amounts for different family sizes; and reserving specific areas of land exclusively for the First Nations living there.
