                <p>
                    Treaty One is still being implemented today. Such as the Kapyong Urban Reserve in Winnipeg, once a military base, is being transformed by Treaty One First Nations into a space for housing, businesses, and community services. Similarly, the Long Plain First Nations Gas Station contributes to local economic growth by providing jobs and revenue for the community. It also provides indigenous people with treaty status to buy tobacco products and gas free from provincial sales tax. These efforts reflect a commitment to restoring land and fostering self-sufficiency for Treaty One communities.
